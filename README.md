# Numpy
  Numpy is the python library which is used to manipulate the N-dimensional arrays.
  The files in this repository contains the operations performed on the data by the different way.

  ### Features of Numpy
  1. It's main feature is N-dimensional array i.e. ndarray.
  2. It enabless to perform faster computations than the python lists.
  3. 3. We can perform vectorization on the data.

  ### Files
  1. The numpy_crash_course file included the different functions performing operations using numpy.
  2. The IPL_Data_Analysis_Project contains the operations and functions performed on the IPL_Data also we visualize the matrix using matplotlib library in python.
  3. In numpy_project file we performed Image to Array conversion using matplotlib and numpy
